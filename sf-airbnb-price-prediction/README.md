San Francisco Airbnb Price Prediction

This project uses supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the Airbnb listing prices based on features such as the number of bedrooms, number of people the house can accommodate, how much the cleaning fee is, how much an extra people should pay, etc. 

A reasonable listing price is important. If it is set too high or too low based on the size of oneâ€™s house, the cleaning fee, or the room type, either the owner would not have the best return, or the customer would not think the stay is worth the money and leave bad review. A good business strategy for Airbnb would target at the double-win of both the owners and renters, so a machine learning predictive pricing guidance would be beneficial to all parties.
